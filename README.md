Billing App is an application where users can draft a custom invoice and download it as a PDF file. Users can register, enter/edit their data, log in, and generate an invoice: 
enter details of the seller, details of the buyer, product or service details, and choose a method for signing the invoice. Users can also view an archive of created invoices and sort it by chosen parameters.
